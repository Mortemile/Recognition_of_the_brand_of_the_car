# Recognition_of_the_brand_of_the_car
This code can determine a car brend by an image. The database contains three brends: Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault

In the mine.py file, you can load any image of the car into the prepocessing_data() function and get the probabilities of what brand of car is shown in the picture.
File create_model.py prepares images, splits dataset into train and test sets, creates layers and model, trains model and gives prediction.
